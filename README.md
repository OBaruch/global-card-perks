# Global Card Perks

Global Card Perks is an open-source platform for centralizing and displaying real-time benefits data from credit card issuers worldwide. Our goal is to aggregate and update, in one unified dashboard, the perks, rewards, discounts, and promotions offered by major networks (such as American Express, Visa, and MasterCard) as well as local banks and neobanks from around the globe.
